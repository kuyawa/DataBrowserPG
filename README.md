#DataBrowser for PostgreSQL
######Developed in Swift 3 and XCode 8 for OSX Sierra

This mac app is a simple browser for PostgreSQL databases to see the content of the tables and nothing else. Right now it does not allow to edit records or schema information. In version 2 we will add more features to make it more functional.

Here are some screenshots of the app:
